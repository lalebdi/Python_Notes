# Intermediate Python Notes


Hi, Thanks for checking this out.

I created these notes while I'm studying Python. Feel free to contribute or fork the repo.

p.s. these are intermediate level notes and I recommend taking a beginners class, however yoou like, and then take a look at these. I wrote comments to help you understand whats going on with the code and general overview.

Cheers
